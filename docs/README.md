## Contributing

If you’re documenting the props and/or behavior of a component, add it to [Components](/components). Your component does not have to be in `src/components` for its documentation to live here.

If you’re documenting a function’s signature and/or purpose, add it to [Utils](/utils). Similarly, your util does not have to be in `src/utils` for its documentation to live here.

If you’re documenting an enhancer or middleware, add it to the respective directory.

If you’re explaining a concept, feature, or system that spans multiple components and utils, or if you’re providing other step-by-step instructions, add it to [Guides](/guides).
