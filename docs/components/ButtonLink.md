# ButtonLink

[`ButtonLink`](/src/components/ButtonLink/index.js) looks like a [`Button`](/docs/components/Button.md) but behaves like a [`Link`](/docs/components/Link.md).

It accepts all the same props as Button, plus `openNewTab` and `to` from Link.

ButtonLinks can be grouped together (with their adjoining edges collapsed) using [ButtonGroup](/docs/components/ButtonGroup.md).
